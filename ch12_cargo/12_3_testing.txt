Place unit tests and integration tests in own tests/ directory

Each file in tests is separate integration test, test meant to test library
if it was being called from a dependent crate

Three testing styles: Unit, Doc, Integration

cargo provides easy way to run all tests -> `cargo test` lol

cargo may run multiple tests concurrently, avoid race conditions
