Sometimes normal cargo build not enough -> maybe code needs...
- some prerequisites before cargo can successfully compile
- code generation
- native code that needs to be compiled

Add a build script like this
[package]
...
build = "build.rs"
Specify for cargo will look for build.rs by default

Build script simply is Rust file that will be compiled and invoked
before rest of package

Build script provides output via stdout
